# Flask app demo: Quering a database and streaming

This is a simple flask app demonstrating how to stream a multimedia file that was queried from a local database. 

## install
    pip install -r requrements.txt

## run
    python run.py
    
It will recreate a database with the audio files provided. On the frontend you can seek for a particular artist and then click one of the links it returns. Obviously, you have to seek for one of three artist, otherwise no result will return.

The particular song will start playing after clicking the particular link.
